# Wiki_Web_Scraping

## Description
This project deals with scraping data from a real website using python and creating a csv at the end to use for its intended purpose. The data chosen is List of countries gdp between 2010 and 2019.

## Dataset details
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_(PPP)#IMF_estimates_between_2010_and_2019
- Details: A simple table pulled from Wikipedia with 11 columns. The first column being the country and the rest are the years ranging from 2010 to 2019

## Purpose
The project aims to showcase the ability to scrape data from the web using python. This is a continuation/step up from the project 'IMDB_data_analysis' which downloaded an pre-made dataset from kaggle.

## What could have been done better?
Reflecting on the project, the dataset chosen could have been more complex or bigger. This would have given the opportunity to create a meaningful dashboard with multiple visualisations.

## Next steps
From using a pre-made dataset to then scraping data from the web, the next step would be to use API to gather data and create visualisations.
